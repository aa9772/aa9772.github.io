[{"content":"Multi-Piston Simulator (Python) Overview The Multi-Piston Simulator is a modular Python project designed to simulate industrial piston systems with realistic control, sensors, and fault behavior. It is aimed at engineers, researchers, and students who want to understand, test, or demonstrate automation concepts without physical hardware.\nThis simulator is particularly useful for:\nEducation: visualizing the dynamics of pistons, sensors, and commands in real time. Research \u0026amp; Development: testing PLC logic, Modbus communication, or control algorithms. Prototyping: quickly iterating piston configurations before moving to real hardware. Why Use This Simulator Safe and fast experimentation: test different piston configurations, command strategies, and faults without risk or cost. Fully configurable via Excel: change number of pistons, strokes, sensors, and control modes in seconds. Visual feedback: intuitive visualization of pistons, rods, sensors, and commands. Modular and extendable: easy to integrate PLC logic, Modbus interfaces, or new simulation features. Consistency across simulations: all pistons share the same scaling and behavior, making comparisons reliable. Fault simulation included: block pistons to test emergency response, logic handling, or PLC reaction. This makes it ideal for anyone looking to learn automation, validate control logic, or showcase industrial simulation skills.\nFeatures Multi-piston simulation with independent movement. Extend and retract commands with single or double command modes. Endstop sensors with color indicators (green = active, red = inactive). Fault simulation (blocking pistons). Labels for each piston, fully configurable via Excel. Real-time animation using Matplotlib. Optional Modbus TCP interface for external control and monitoring. Visualization \u0026amp; Interaction The simulator provides clear visual feedback for each piston:\nCylinder and rod: motion accurately reflects stroke configuration. Piston head: moves with rod to show current position. Endstop sensors: indicate whether pistons are fully retracted or extended. Command indicators: show which commands are active in real time. Fault indicators: simulate blocked pistons for testing emergency response. This makes it possible to observe control logic and physical response simultaneously, bridging the gap between theory and practice.\nGetting Started Requirements Python 3.8+ Libraries: pandas, matplotlib, openpyxl, pyModbusTCP (if using Modbus) Excel for configuration Install dependencies:\npip install pandas matplotlib openpyxl pyModbusTCP Running the Simulator Clone the repository:\ngit clone https://github.com/aa9772/piston-sim.git cd piston-sim Run the simulator with the default configuration:\npython -m piston_sim.main Or specify a custom Excel file:\npython -m piston_sim.main path_to_your_excel.xlsx Excel Configuration Pistons are fully configurable via Excel. Configure:\nColumn Description ID Piston identifier Label Displayed label above piston Stroke Maximum piston extension Sensor Retract \u0026lsquo;Yes\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;No\u0026rsquo; Sensor Extend \u0026lsquo;Yes\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;No\u0026rsquo; Single/Double Command \u0026lsquo;Single\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;Double\u0026rsquo; command mode Speed Optional, piston movement speed Why Excel? Non-technical users can change piston setup without editing code. Quick experimentation with different numbers of pistons or stroke lengths. Easily integrates with PLC and Modbus simulation logic.
