[{"content":"Index The Project The Challenges Contribution Authorship, Contributions, and Acknowledgements The Project In partnership with Montecatone Clinic, the ReMovAble Project aims to support people with spinal cord injuries. We are developing an innovative glove designed to restore hand mobility and improve the everyday lives of quadriplegic patients.\nMore than just a technological innovation, this project is about people. A passionate team of students and researchers drives ReMovAble, motivated by volunteerism and collaboration. Their dedication shows how engineering can change lives and the real impact that collective research can have on society.\nThe Challenges The ReMovAble Project faces several significant challenges on its path to restoring hand mobility for quadriplegic patients. Each of these challenges represents a critical step in turning an innovative concept into a practical, life-changing device:\nPractical Design: The glove must be comfortable, lightweight, and easy to wear, while allowing natural hand movements. Designing a wearable device that patients can use daily without fatigue or discomfort is a major engineering challenge.\nHuman-Machine Interface: Translating the user\u0026rsquo;s intentions into precise hand movements requires an intuitive and seamless interface. The system must interpret subtle signals accurately, enabling smooth control without cognitive overload for the user.\nSensing and Feedback: Accurate sensing and real-time feedback are crucial for safe and effective operation. Developing a system that reliably detects the user’s inputs, monitors hand position, and provides responsive actuation ensures the glove behaves predictably and helps the user regain functional movement.\nSuccessfully addressing these challenges is essential to creating a device that is not only technologically advanced, but also practical, reliable, and empowering for those who need it most.\nContribution A crucial part of the ReMovAble Project has been enabling the glove to accurately sense and respond to user intentions. One of the most demanding challenges was measuring the resistance of the actuation cable reliably. The task was far from straightforward: the signals were extremely small, susceptible to electrical noise and environmental interference, and needed to be captured in real-time to allow smooth hand movements.\nTo overcome this, a dedicated electronic circuit was developed and iteratively refined. Multiple designs were tested to find the optimal balance between sensitivity and stability, ensuring that even the tiniest variations in resistance could be detected consistently and accurately.\nBut capturing the data was only half the challenge. The raw resistance readings had to be interpreted and translated into actionable commands for the actuators. This required careful signal processing, calibration, and continuous testing, tuning the system so that every detected variation corresponded precisely to the intended hand movement.\nThrough this iterative process, a robust sensing-actuation interface emerged, capable of delivering smooth, reliable, and safe responses to user input. This work not only solved a complex technical problem but also laid the foundation for a glove that can become a functional assistive device, capable of improving the daily lives of quadriplegic patients.\nAuthorship, Contributions, and Acknowledgements The ReMovAble Project is a multidisciplinary initiative focused on developing an assistive wearable device to support hand mobility in individuals with spinal cord injuries.

GitHub Repository License Example: Two Pistons Configuration Overview The Multi-Piston Simulator is a modular Python project designed to simulate industrial piston systems with realistic control, sensors, and fault behavior. It is aimed at engineers, researchers, and students who want to understand, test, or demonstrate automation concepts without physical hardware.\nThis simulator is particularly useful for:\nEducation: visualizing the dynamics of pistons, sensors, and commands in real time. Research \u0026amp; Development: testing PLC logic, Modbus communication, or control algorithms. Prototyping: quickly iterating piston configurations before moving to real hardware. Why Use This Simulator Safe and fast experimentation: test different piston configurations, command strategies, and faults without risk or cost. Fully configurable via Excel: change number of pistons, strokes, sensors, and control modes in seconds. Visual feedback: intuitive visualization of pistons, rods, sensors, and commands. Modular and extendable: easy to integrate PLC logic, Modbus interfaces, or new simulation features. Consistency across simulations: all pistons share the same scaling and behavior, making comparisons reliable. Fault simulation included: block pistons to test emergency response, logic handling, or PLC reaction. This makes it ideal for anyone looking to learn automation, validate control logic, or showcase industrial simulation skills.\nFeatures Multi-piston simulation with independent movement. Extend and retract commands with single or double command modes. Endstop sensors with color indicators (green = active, red = inactive). Fault simulation (blocking pistons). Labels for each piston, fully configurable via Excel. Real-time animation using Matplotlib. Optional Modbus TCP interface for external control and monitoring. Visualization \u0026amp; Interaction The simulator provides clear visual feedback for each piston:\nCylinder and rod: motion accurately reflects stroke configuration. Piston head: moves with rod to show current position. Endstop sensors: indicate whether pistons are fully retracted or extended. Command indicators: show which commands are active in real time. Fault indicators: simulate blocked pistons for testing emergency response. This makes it possible to observe control logic and physical response simultaneously, bridging the gap between theory and practice.\nGetting Started Requirements Python 3.8+ Libraries: pandas, matplotlib, openpyxl, pyModbusTCP (if using Modbus) Excel for configuration Install dependencies:\npip install pandas matplotlib openpyxl pyModbusTCP Running the Simulator Clone the repository:\ngit clone https://github.com/aa9772/piston-sim.git cd piston-sim Run the simulator with the default configuration:\npython -m piston_sim.main Or specify a custom Excel file:\npython -m piston_sim.main path_to_your_excel.xlsx Excel Configuration Pistons are fully configurable via Excel.
