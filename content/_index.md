&nbsp;


An exploration of engineering  
at the intersection of structure, constraints, and reasoning.

&nbsp;

---

&nbsp;

This space collects notes, ideas, and ongoing work  
around systems that interact with the physical world,  
where models, assumptions, and implementations must align.

&nbsp;

---

&nbsp;

The focus is on automation, control,  
and system behavior over time,  
with attention to rigor, consistency, and design choices.

&nbsp;

---

&nbsp;

Engineering is approached as a disciplined process:  
formulating problems,  
reasoning about limits,  
and building systems that behave predictably.

The content evolves through study and application,  
reflecting questions, abstractions,  
and incremental understanding.
