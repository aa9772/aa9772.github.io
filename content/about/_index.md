I am currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Automation Engineering at the Alma Mater Studiorum - University of Bologna, where I also earned my Bachelor’s degree. My academic journey has been shaped by a fascination with how complex systems work and how they can be controlled, optimized, and improved. From the early days of my undergraduate studies, I was drawn to the challenge of understanding industrial processes, control systems, and automation technologies at a deep, structural level.

Throughout my studies, I have explored a wide range of topics, including PLC programming, motion control, real-time scheduling, and system optimization. Each project and course has strengthened not only my technical skills, but also my curiosity and critical thinking, pushing me to ask not just “how” things work, but “why” and “how they could work better.”

Beyond the classroom, I have applied my knowledge as a PLC programmer, gaining hands-on experience in designing and implementing solutions for real-world industrial systems. This combination of rigorous academic training and practical experience has taught me to approach problems with both analytical precision and creative problem-solving.

I see my academic path as more than a series of courses and projects; it is an ongoing exploration of technology, innovation, and the ways in which engineering can improve efficiency, intelligence, and adaptability in industrial systems. My goal is to continue contributing to this field, bridging the gap between research and practice, and always seeking new ways to learn, experiment, and grow.
