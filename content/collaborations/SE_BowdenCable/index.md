## The Project

In partnership with Montecatone Clinic, the **ReMovAble Project** aims to support people with spinal cord injuries. We are developing an innovative glove designed to restore hand mobility and improve the everyday lives of quadriplegic patients.

More than just a technological innovation, this project is about people. A passionate team of students and researchers drives ReMovAble, motivated by volunteerism and collaboration. Their dedication shows how engineering can change lives and the real impact that collective research can have on society.

## The Challenges

The **ReMovAble Project** faces several significant challenges on its path to restoring hand mobility for quadriplegic patients. Each of these challenges represents a critical step in turning an innovative concept into a **practical, life-changing device**:  

- **Practical Design:** The glove must be **comfortable, lightweight, and easy to wear**, while allowing natural hand movements. Designing a wearable device that patients can use daily without fatigue or discomfort is a major engineering challenge.  

- **Human-Machine Interface:** Translating the user's intentions into precise hand movements requires an **intuitive and seamless interface**. The system must interpret subtle signals accurately, enabling smooth control without cognitive overload for the user.  

- **Sensing and Feedback:** Accurate sensing and real-time feedback are crucial for **safe and effective operation**. Developing a system that reliably detects the user’s inputs, monitors hand position, and provides responsive actuation ensures the glove behaves predictably and helps the user regain functional movement.  

Successfully addressing these challenges is essential to creating a device that is not only **technologically advanced**, but also **practical, reliable, and empowering** for those who need it most.

## Contribution

A crucial part of the ReMovAble Project has been enabling the glove to **accurately sense and respond to user intentions**. One of the most demanding challenges was **measuring the resistance of the actuation cable reliably**. The task was far from straightforward: the signals were extremely small, susceptible to **electrical noise and environmental interference**, and needed to be captured in **real-time** to allow smooth hand movements.  

To overcome this, a dedicated **electronic circuit** was developed and iteratively refined. Multiple designs were tested to find the optimal balance between **sensitivity and stability**, ensuring that even the tiniest variations in resistance could be detected **consistently and accurately**.  

But capturing the data was only half the challenge. The raw resistance readings had to be **interpreted and translated into actionable commands** for the actuators. This required careful **signal processing, calibration, and continuous testing**, tuning the system so that every detected variation corresponded precisely to the intended hand movement.  

Through this iterative process, a **robust sensing-actuation interface** emerged, capable of delivering **smooth, reliable, and safe responses** to user input. This work not only solved a complex technical problem but also laid the foundation for a glove that can become a **functional assistive device**, capable of improving the daily lives of quadriplegic patients.
